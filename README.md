# protonMailGenerator
A E-Mail Generator


### WHAT MAKES THIS BETTER


The mail is ready when the script is done. It will already be VERIFIED and NO further manual VERIFICATION needed not like at other generators

### USAGE

It is used to generate a protonmail mail for you which you can fully access
